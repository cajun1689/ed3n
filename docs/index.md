# Welcome to **ED3N Hydro Boards**

Start growing smarter—without a tangle of breadboards or weeks of wiring.  
ED3N boards give everyone from weekend hobbyists to research labs a **plug-and-play control platform** for hydroponics.

> **Why we built them**  
> *To make the first step into hydro automation as easy as stacking a HAT on a Pi—or, with our Pro board, skipping the Pi entirely.*
